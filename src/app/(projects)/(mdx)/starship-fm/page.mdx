## Overview

Starship.fm is an active music exploration app, meant to live alongside existing streaming services. Its target audience is those who find Spotify or other services' "exploration" features to be lacking.

This design was created as part of the DSGN 2570 (UI/UX Design) course at UPenn.

## The goal

Originally, the goals for this project were much looser. I wanted to incorporate the idea of a visually mapped out web of musical genres and artists, as well as allow users to dynamically explore said map. Along with this, I wanted to allow users to leave "notes" or something similar behind for each other, creating unique moments of realization that a friend is a fan of some music without recommendations being made back and forth.

However, through user research and testing, the scope was narrowed to a single goal: an app allowing active music exploration.
